# Ecommerce-Project
A Web Developement Project

This is a web developement project based on Python (Django), HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
The aim is to make a ecommerce website.

As of now, there is the home page of the store with selected items, a page for the cart, a page for checkout and an admin page. 
For adding items to cart, one has to login via the admin page. 
Then after adding the items to cart, you can increase , decrease or remove items from the cart page.
In the checkout page, if the purchased item is digital, no need for shipping address. Otherwise fill in the shipping details.
Then if you click on "Make Payment", an alert will come that you have made the payment and will be redirected to the home page.

The steps can also be seen in the console inspecting the web page.
